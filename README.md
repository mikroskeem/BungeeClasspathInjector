# BungeeClasspathInjector

Plugins missing some libraries? Fear no more!
With this plugin you can easily add extra libraries into BungeeCord's plugins (and its forks) classpath.

This plugin was made for `Chadster#7455`, who couldn't get my plugin [BenjiAuth](https://github.com/mikroskeem/BenjiAuth) reliably
running on proxy because of latency issues on Shockbyte

## Usage

In plugin data folder, there's a `libs` subdirectory. Put desired libraries in there and enjoy.
